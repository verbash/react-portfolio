            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h3>Work</h3>
            <p>
                With over five years of dedicated experience as a Full-Stack Web
                Developer, I bring to the table a compelling fusion of technical
                expertise, charismatic leadership, and a knack for fostering
                collaboration. My proficiency spans across JavaScript, React,
                Redux, HTML/CSS, PHP/Twig, and UI architecture, complemented by
                an insatiable curiosity for emerging technologies. Drawing from
                my background as a former Retail Store Manager at Guitar Center,
                I've honed invaluable leadership skills and cultivated a talent
                for team collaboration. This unique blend positions me not only
                as a proficient developer but also as a mentor capable of
                guiding and inspiring peers towards collective success. My
                proficiency extends beyond individual skill sets; I have a
                robust foundation in component-based UI architectures, coupled
                with expertise in Sass and Webpack, enabling me to architect
                efficient systems and spearhead innovation with confidence. I am
                genuinely excited about opportunities that allow me to leverage
                both my technical prowess and leadership experience to
                contribute meaningfully to projects and teams alike. In essence,
                I am poised to drive excellence and innovation in web
                development, eager to embark on new challenges and make
                impactful contributions wherever I go.

            <h3>Life</h3>
            <p>
                I am a dedicated husband and father of two, and I am passionate
                about music, technology, and the great outdoors. I love spending
                time with my family, playing guitar, and exploring the beautiful
                Pacific Northwest. I enjoy immersing myself in the natural
                wonders of the region running, hiking, or bicycle riding. I am
                also a dedicated musician and have been singing, playing guitar
                and synthesizer, and producing music for over 20 years. My love
                for music extends beyond playing; I am also an avid collector of
                vinyl records and enjoy discovering new music and artists. I am
                a lifelong learner and am always seeking new opportunities to
                expand my knowledge and skills. I am excited about the future
                and look forward to the adventures that lie ahead.
